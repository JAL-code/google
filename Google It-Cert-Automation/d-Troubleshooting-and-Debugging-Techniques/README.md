Forth course in the Google It-Cert-Automation.

Organization: Week-Quiz-Lecture/Reading-[Summary] Example [W1-Q1-L3-Debugging] [W1-Q1-00-Intro_to_Debugging]

- Lecture: Keywords/Concepts/Terminal Input/Sample Code [primary purpose for folders, exams might not be recorded here.]
- Readings: Keywords/Concepts
- Tests: Concepts/Solution

Note: Some of the code for this class may not work. Much of it was not provided in a downloadable format. After taking the class, the better method would be to note the commands used and run them on personal examples from the previous class.  I will be revisiting this folder as many of the concepts are more advanced than skills I currently use.
