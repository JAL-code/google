    [The nuclear option of using chrt -f to bypass autogroups using SCHED_FIFO for something you don't want to have cpu time stolen from by lower-priority processes. Of course this only works on interactive processes as opposed to batch ones, or else your system could hang. While it's a clumsy solution, notably this is an option that someone who isn't aware of autogroups might still come up with on their own.]
