[we need to understand how each component interacts with the other and what the limitations are.]
[understand the different speeds of the parts involved.]
[variable that's currently being used in a function, the data will be in the CPU's internal memory, and our program will retrieve it really fast.]
[data is related to a running program but maybe not the currently executing function, it will likely be in RAM, and our program will still get to a pretty fast.]
[file, our program will need to read it from disk, which is much slower than reading it from RAM, and worse than reading from disk, is reading information from over the network.]
[lower transmission speed, and we also need to establish the connection to the other endpoint to make the transmission possible, which adds to the total time needed to get to the data.]
[figure out if you can read it once stored on disk, and then read it from disk afterwards.]
[cache, a cache stores data in a form that's faster to access than its original form.]
[A web proxy is a form of cache.]
[accessed often by users behind the proxy.]
[don't need to be downloaded from the Internet every time.]
[need to query from the Internet every time someone asks for their IP address.]
[operating system]
[keep as much information as possible in RAM so that we can access it fast.]
[contents of files or libraries that are accessed often, even if they aren't in use right now.]
[cached in memory.]
[We call that that if the data is part of a program that's currently running, it will be in RAM.]
[run out of RAM?]
[first, the OS will just remove from RAM anything that's cached, but not strictly necessary.]
[the operating system will put the parts of the memory that aren't currently in use onto the hard drive in a space called swap.]
[Reading and writing from disk is much slower than reading and writing from RAM.]
[take a while to load it back.]
[But if the available memory is significantly less than what the running applications need, the OS will have to keep swapping out the data that's not in use right now to move the data currently in use to RAM, and as we called out, our computer can switch between applications very quickly, which means that the data currently in use can also change very quickly.]
[super slow.]
[a lot of time swapping?]
[First, if there are too many open applications and some can be closed, close the ones that aren't needed.]
[add more RAM to the computer.]
[third reason is that one of the running programs may have a memory leak, causing it to take all the available memory.]
