[*Caption:"Why is my computer slow?":02*]
[The general strategy for addressing slowness is to identify the bottleneck for addressing slowness in our device, our script, or our system to run slowly.]
[CPU time]
[time spent reading data from disk waiting for data transmitted over the network, moving data from disk to RAM, or some other resource that's limiting the overall performance.]
[speed things up by getting rid of anything else that's using resources on the same computer.]
[close other running programs that you don't need right then.]
[don't have enough space on disk, you can uninstall applications that you don't use, or delete or move data that doesn't need to be on that disk.]
[more network bandwidth, you can try stopping any other processes that are also using the network and so on.]
[too many processes trying to use the same resource]
[hardware we're using just isn't good]
[upgrade the underlying hardware.]
[make sure that we're actually improving the bottleneck and not just wasting our money on new hardware that will go unused.]
[which piece of hardware needs to be changed?]
[exhausted.]
[being used completely and programs are getting blocked by not having access to more of it.]
[Is it the CPU, the memory, the disk IO, the network connection, the graphics card?]
[we use the tools available in our operating system, monitor the usage of each resource, and then work out which one is blocking our programs for running faster.]
[top on Linux]
[sort by memory, which ones are using the most memory. It also shows a bunch of other load information related to the current state of the computer, like how many processes are running and how the CPU time or memory is being used.]
[iotop and iftop.]
[processes are currently using the most disk IO usage or the most network bandwidth.]
[MacOS, the OS ships with a tool called Activity Monitor which lets us see what's using the most CPU, memory, energy, disk, or network.]
[Windows, there's a couple of OS tools called Resource Monitor and Performance Monitor which also let us analyze what's going on with the different resources on the computer including CPU, memory, disk and network.]
[Of course, not all performance problems are solved by closing applications or getting better hardware.]
[need to figure out what the software is doing wrong and where it's spending most of its time to understand how to make it run faster.]
