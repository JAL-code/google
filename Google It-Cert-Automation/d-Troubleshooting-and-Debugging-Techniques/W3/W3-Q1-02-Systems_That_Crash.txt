[So what you need to do is reduce the scope of the problem, and remember, you want to start with the actions that are easier and faster to check.]
[As a first step, you tried looking at the logs to see if there's any error that may point to what's happening, but you only find an error saying application terminated and no useful information.]
[So you check if the user can reproduce the problem by doing this same action on a different computer.]
[the problem just has to do with the installation or configuration on that specific computer. ]
[Another thing that you might want to check is if this happens reliably.]
[That's rather suspicious, but not so fast.]
[The application seems to be crashing randomly but only on that computer.]
[application or the whole system.]
[try moving away the local configuration for the program and using the default configuration instead,]
[the user tells you that their web browser also crashed last week when they were using the internal webmail.]
[overall system, either the hardware or the OS installation.]
[spare computer available, it might make sense to give one to the user at this point so that they can go back to work while you try to figure out the root cause of the problem.]
[hardware related.]
[hard drive out of the computer and putting it into a different computer.]
[That way you can quickly check if it's a problem with the data and the drive or the rest of the computer.]
[The next step is to find out which one. Given the random crashes, one thing to check would be the RAM.]
[To check the health of our RAM, we can use the *memtest 86 tool to look for errors.]
[You can do this by disconnecting or replacing the devices present in the computer and checking if the crashes still occur.]
[So what can you do if when putting the hard drive in a separate computer, you still get the strange caches? This means the problem is in the drive itself or the OS installation.]
[If the installation is easy to replicate, then just reinstalling the OS might be faster and simpler than looking into why it broke.]
