[For this example, let's say you find a bunch of entries in the logs that say, invalid response from server.]
[the request was or what the response ]
[We said that this started failing recently, so it might make sense to figure out what changed between what it was working correctly and when it started to fail.]
[Was there a new version of the system deployed? Were there any relevant changes regarding the requests?]
[Whether you do the rollback or not, when coming across unhelpful error messages, it's a good idea to improve them.]
[change it to include what the request and the response were, and why the response was invalid.]
[In a case like this, you'd start by first removing the machine from the pool of servers that can provide this service. That way, you avoid users getting any more errors.]
[ good logs is essential to understanding what's going on. On top of that, you'll want to have good monitoring of what the service is doing and use version control for all changes so that you can quickly check what's changed and roll back when needed.]
[keeping standby servers,]
[tested pipeline that allows you to deploy new servers on demand.]
[But one thing to take into account when the servers are running as virtual machines, especially if they're running in the cloud, is that there might be external limits apply to these services. Resources, like the available CPU time, RAM, or network bandwidth, might be artificially capped.]
