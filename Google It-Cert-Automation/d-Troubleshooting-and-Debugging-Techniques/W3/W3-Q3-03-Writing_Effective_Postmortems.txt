[What you can learn from the problem and how you can prevent it in the future.]

[that we were able to solve the problem quickly by doing a roll back to the previous version or that we caught the issue before users even noticed it because we had good monitoring and alerting.]
[Noting the things that went well helps us show that our systems are effective and justifies keeping those systems running.]
