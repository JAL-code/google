[When working on a problem, it's always a good idea to document what you're doing in a bug or ticket.]
[Documenting what you do, lets you keep track of what you've tried and what the results were.]
[They want to know what you figured out about the problem, what the available workarounds are, and when they can expect the next update.]
[But the more people affected, the more you'll want to provide regular updates with clear instructions of what users can do and what they can expect as a solution.]
[If access to the Internet is down, you want to let people know if they can expect to fix in one or two hours or if it's going to take the whole day.]
[divide the causes among the team members and have them work on those in parallel.]
[This communications lead needs to know what's going on and provide timely updates on the current state and how long until the problem's resolved.]
[Similarly, there should be one person in charge of delegating the different tasks to the team members. This person sometimes called the Incident Commander or Incident Controller needs to look at the big picture and decide what's the best use of the available resources.]
[Having multiple people make overlapping changes to the system could lead to confusing results, making the outage even longer.]
