[One common reason a program crashes is it's trying to access invalid memory.]
[So accessing invalid memory means that the process tried to access a portion of the system's memory that wasn't assigned to it.]
[the OS will raise an error like segmentation fault or general protection fault.]
[In these languages, the variables that store memory addresses are called pointers.]
[Common programming errors that lead to segmentation faults or segfaults include forgetting to initialize a variable, trying to access a list element outside of the valid range, trying to use a portion of memory after having given it back, and trying to write more data than the requested portion of memory can hold.]
[The best way to understand what's going on is to attach a debugger to the faulty program. This way when the program crashes, you'll get information about the function where the fault happened. You'll know the parameters that the function received and find out the address that was invalid.]
[For this to be possible, we'll need our program to be compiled with debugging symbols.]
[Linux distributions like Debian or Ubuntu ships separate packages with the debugging symbols for all the packages in the distribution. So to debug and application that's segfaulting, we download the debugging symbols for that application. Attach a debugger to it, and see where the fault occurs.]
[Microsoft compilers can also generate debugging symbols in a separate PDB file.]
[One of the trickiest things about this invalid memory business is that we're usually dealing with undefined behavior. This means that the code is doing something that's not valid in the programming language.]
[Valgrind is a very powerful tool that can tell us if the code is doing any invalid operations no matter if it crashes are not.]
[Valgrind is available on Linux and Mac OS,]
[Dr. Memory is a similar tool that can be used on both Windows and Linux.]
[If a variable is initialized too late, fixing the problem can be as easy as moving the initialization to the right part of the code,]
