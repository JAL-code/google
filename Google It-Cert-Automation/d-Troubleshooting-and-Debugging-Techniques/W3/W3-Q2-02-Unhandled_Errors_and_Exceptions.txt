[In Python, for example, we could get an IndexError if we tried to access an element after the end of a list.]
[We might get a TypeError or an AttributeError if we try to take an action on a variable that wasn't properly initialized or DivisionByZeroError if we tried to well, divide by zero.]
[The traceback shows the lines of the different functions that were being executed when the problem happened.]
[So when the error message isn't enough, we'll need to debug the code to find out where things are going wrong.]
[This technique is called printf debugging.]
[The name comes from the print f function used to print messages to the screen in the C programming language.]
[use print, puts, or echo to display the text on the screen.]
[In Python, we can do this using the *logging module. This module, lets us set how comprehensive we want our code to be.]
[In general, you'll want to make the program more resilient to failures. Instead of crashing unexpectedly, you want the program to inform the user of the problem and tell them what they need to do.]
