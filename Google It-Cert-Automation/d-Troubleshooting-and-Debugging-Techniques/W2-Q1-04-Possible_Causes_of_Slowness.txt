[use the process of elimination that we looked at earlier.]
[first look for the simplest explanations that are the easiest to check.]
[back to the problem and come up with the next possible cause to check.]
[first step is to look into when the computer is slow.]
[In this case, fixing the problem is just a question of going through the list of programs that start automatically and disabling any that aren't really needed.]
[sluggish after days of running just fine, and the problem goes away with a reboot, it means that there's a program that's keeping some state while running that's causing the computer to slow down.]
[data keeps growing over time, without deleting old values.]
[the computer runs out of RAM.]
[change the code so that it frees up some of the memory used.]
[another option is to schedule a regular restart to mitigate both the slow program and your computer running out of RAM.]
[ the files that an application is handling have grown too large.]
[fix the bug.]
[can't modify the code of the program?]
[reduce the size of the files involved.]
[file is a log file, you can use a program like logrotate to do this for you.]
[write your own tool to rotate the contents.]
[is whether this happens for all users of the application or just a subset of them.]
[If only some users are affected, we'll want to know if there's something that's configured differently on those computers that might be triggering the slowness.]
[tracks the files in our computer]
[but can get in the way of everyday use if we have tons of files and not the most powerful hardware.]
[reading from the network is notably slower than reading from disk.]
[we'll need to make sure that the directory used by the program to read and write most of its data is a directory local to the computer.]
[Hardware failures can also cause our computer to become slow.]
[apply error correction to get the data that it needs, but it will affect the overall performance.]
[OS utilities that diagnose problems on hard drives or on RAM, and check if there's anything that could be causing problems.]
[another source of slowness is malicious software.]
