[The first step is to make a list of all of the tasks that need to get done. You can make this list on a piece of paper, a text file in your computer, a bug tracking system, or a ticket management system.]
[Once you have the list, you can check the real urgency of the tasks.]
[if any items don't get done today will something bad happen?]
[Once you're done with the most critically urgent tasks, you can look at the rest of the list and assess the importance of each issue.]
[For example, a task that will benefit more people is more important than a task that will benefit less people.]
[If it still seems like everything is on fire, you can try dividing the tasks into groups of most important, important, and not so important.]
[sort the tasks inside each group, but don't spend too much time doing this sorting.]
[Once you have a list of the most important tasks to work on, you'll want to have a rough idea of how much effort they'll take.]
[rough sizes.]
[small, medium, and large.]
[Once you identify the most important tasks and how big they are, you can start working on them.]
[start with the larger,]
[One strategy that can help us with that is saving the most complex tasks for the moments when we're less likely to get interrupted.]
[busiest in the morning]
[ work on easy and quick tasks early in the day.]
[The key here is to always work on important tasks.]
[But keep in mind, this shouldn't stop you from taking a break or working on experimental projects.]
[Taking breaks is important because it allows our creative minds to stay fresh,]
[The first thing to know is this is normal, most people working in IT have too much to do and can't get all the things they want done.]
