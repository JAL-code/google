[missing resources.]
[Planning ahead will prepare you for when you need additional resources, instead of having to scramble for them at the last minute.]
[keep growing at that pace.]
[don't forget to write this down so you can refer to it in the future and check if anything has changed.]
[In that case, you might opt for buying a network attached storage or NAS that can be attached to your server for additional disk space.]
[monitoring the usage growth of the computer to see if there are any trends that need attention.]
[Our monitoring system should trigger an automatic alert when that's the case.]
[If you have a process that's CPU intensive and takes almost all the available CPU on a computer, you can still run processes that are IO intensive, reading and writing a lot of data to the hard drive.]
[lot of RAM, you can pair it with another one that uses very little memory, and mostly sends and receives data over the network.]
[An alternative for having to deal with all these resources like figuring out when to buy more and how to distribute them, is to migrate those systems to the Cloud. Setting up your service to run on the cloud will require some initial setup time, as well as an ongoing cost for the Cloud resources you're using.]
