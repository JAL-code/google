[So how do we do that without a crystal ball? One key strategy is to make good use of monitoring.]
[The short version of it is that you want the computers you care about to send their data to a centralized location that aggregates all this information.]
[When you first set up a monitoring system, you might not be sure what information to prioritize, so start with the basics, CPU, disk, memory, and network usage.]
[other metrics that you'd like to include in your monitoring system.]
[temperature sensor's data in your monitoring system.]
[And whenever you have to deal with an incident that wasn't caught by the monitoring system, remember to set up new monitoring and alerting rules that will notify you about the problem if it ever happens again.]
[include the measurements taken along a period of time.]
[If you have to work around an issue in an application developed by someone else, it's important that you report a bug to the relevant developers.]
[Let them know what you were trying to achieve, what you did, what the expected result was, and what the actual result was.]
[reproduction case and workarounds for the issue.]
[On the flip side, if you have to work around an issue in the software that you own, make sure that you write a test that catches the problem.]
[So make sure you perform these tests whenever a new version of the application comes around.]
