[Even if we have an automated process for setting up new computers, which means there's very little manual work, to have successful interactions with our users, it's important to understand these implicit expectations and let users know if fixing the problem will take longer than they expect.]
[Say you have to replace a keyboard but you have no spares available. This means, you'll need to buy a new one or maybe even a whole batch to have a spare available next time.]
[It's important to communicate upfront to the user that in this case, the replacements will take more time and then figure out how critical getting the replacement is.]
[If the user is an accountant, working on the salary deposit order, which needs to be sent to the bank in one hour or nobody gets their payment on time, you might opt for giving them your keyboard while you go and buy another one at the closest hardware store.]
[On the flip side, if the user can work on their laptop until the next day when a new batch of keyboards is scheduled to arrive, you don't need to go out of your way to get early replacement.]
[Even if the user request is quick and easy to solve, fixing the database is critical and affects the whole company, so it should take priority.]
[make sure you tell the user that you're dealing with a crisis and that you'll help with their request once the crisis is resolved, give them an idea of when they can expect their issue to be fixed so they can plan what to do next.]
[Try to be clear and upfront about when you expect the issue will be resolved, and if for any reason the issue isn't solved by then, explain why and what the new expectation should be.]
[Notice a theme, estimating the time it takes to perform more complicated work is tough.]
[if possible it's a really good idea to have users filed the requests through a ticket tracking system.]
[Having all the work you need to do in one place lets you organize your tasks by priority as we discussed before.]
[Finally, try out some practical shortcuts when dealing with users.]
[For example, if a user tells you that their mouse doesn't work, your first instinct might be to go check it yourself and then bring a new one if necessary, but that's a lot of back and forth, instead you could ask the user to bring the faulty mouse to you so that you can test it at your computer and if it's broken change it with a new one or even better, if you trust your users, you might even leave a set of mice, keyboards, and other accessories available for users to take when the one they're using breaks down.]
