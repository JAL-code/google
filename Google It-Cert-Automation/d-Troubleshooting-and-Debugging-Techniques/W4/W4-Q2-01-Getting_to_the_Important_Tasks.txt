[But, there's another resource that's even more valuable in our day to day, our time.]
[One that's super effective when working in IT is the Eisenhower Decision Matrix. When using this method, we split tasks into two different categories: urgent and important.]
[Other tasks might seem urgent, but aren't really important.]
[interruptions that we need to deal with are in this category.]
[Answering email, phone calls, texts, or instant messages feel like something that we need to do right away.]
[neither important nor urgent.]
[distractions and time wasters]
[These include: meetings where nothing useful is being discussed, email threads that lead to nowhere, office gossip, no thanks, and any other tasks that eat up our time without giving anything valuable in return.]
[Until we have fixed the sticks, the workaround we created is technical debt because we need to spend time keeping it in place even if it's not the best solution.]
[Technical debt can also be generated by external parties.]
[So we've made it clear that we need to focus our work on tasks that are important, but what can we do about interruptions which are urgent but not important?]
[effectively.]
[If you work on a team, you can rotate the person dealing with those interruptions.]
[If you work independently, you can try to establish a set of ours when users can expect to reach you for a normal requests, and the rest of the time only be available for emergencies.]
