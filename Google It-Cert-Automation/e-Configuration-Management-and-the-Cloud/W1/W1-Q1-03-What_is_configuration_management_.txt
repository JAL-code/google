[By manually deploying the installation and configuring the computer, we see that we're using unmanaged configuration.]
[current operating system and the applications installed to any necessary configuration files or policies, including anything else that's relevant for the server to do its job.]
[When you work in IT, you're generally in charge of the configuration of a lot of different devices, not just servers. Network routers printers and even smart home devices can have configuration that we can control.]
[a network switch might use a config file to set up each of its ports.]
[It means using a configuration management system to handle all of the configuration of the devices in your fleet, also known as nodes.]
[define a set of rules that have to be applied to the nodes you want to manage and then have a process that ensures that those settings are true on each of the nodes.]
[Configuration management systems aim to solve this scaling problem.]
[because the system will deploy the configuration automatically no matter how many devices you're managing.]
[Instead, you edit the configuration management rules and then let the automation apply those rules in the affected machines.]
[systematic, repeatable way.]
[Being repeatable is important because it means that the results will be the same on all the devices.]
[some application]
[to be very insecure.]
[add rules to your configuration management system to improve the settings on all computers.]
[It will continue to monitor the configuration going forward.]
[user changes the settings on their machine, the configuration management tooling will detect this change and reapply the settings you defined in code.]
[Puppet, Chef, Ansible, and CFEngine.]
[Think bare metal or virtual machines, like the laptops or work stations that employees use at a company.]
[Cloud integration allowing them to manage resources in Cloud environments like Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure, or the Google Cloud platform, and the list doesn't stop there.]
[platform specific tools, like SCCM and Group Policy for Windows.]
[specific environments, even when they aren't as flexible as the others.]
[Puppet because it's the current industry standard for configuration management.]
[selecting a configuration management system is a lot like deciding on a programming language or version control system.]
