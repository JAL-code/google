[when we use a configuration management system, we write rules that describe how the computers in our fleet should be configured.]
[model the behavior of our IT infrastructure in files that can be processed by automatic tools.]
[tracked in a version control system.]
[track of all changes ]
[answer questions like who, when, and why.]
[revert changes.]
[Infrastructure as Code or IaC.]
[In other words, we see that we're using Infrastructure as Code when all of the configuration necessary to deploy and manage a node in the infrastructure is stored in version control.]
[combined with automatic tooling to actually get the nodes provisioned and managed.]
[you can very quickly deploy a new device if something breaks down.]
[The principals of Infrastructure as Code are commonly applied in cloud computing environments, where machines are treated like interchangeable resources, instead of individual computers. ]
[from servers to laptops, or even workstations in a small IT department.]
[One valuable benefit of this process is that the configuration applied to the device doesn't depend on a human remembering to follow all the necessary steps.]
[deployment consistent.]
[Since the configuration of our computers is stored in files, those files can be added to a VCS.]
[an audit trail of changes,]
[ quickly rollback if a change was wrong,]
[others reviewed our code to catch errors and distribute knowledge,]
[improves collaboration with the rest of the team,]
[easily check out the state of our infrastructure by looking at the rules that are committed.]
[ability to easily see what configuration changes were made and roll back to a known good state is super important.]
[I've had my fair share of outages caused by an innocent-looking change with unintended side effects.]
[On top of that, having the rules stored in files means that we can also run automated tests on them.]
[In a complex or large environment, treating your IT Infrastructure as Code can help you deploy a flexible scalable system.]
[To sum all of this up, managing your Infrastructure as Code it means that your fleet of nodes are consistent, versioned, reliable, and repeatable.]
[machines are treated as replaceable resources that can be deployed on-demand through the automation.]
[Performing an action like adding more servers to handle an increase in requests is just a possible first step. There are other things that we might need to take into account, such as the amount of traffic that network can handle or the load on the back end servers like databases.]
