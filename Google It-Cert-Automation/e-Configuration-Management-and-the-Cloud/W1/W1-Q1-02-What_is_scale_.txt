[Being able to scale what we do means that we can keep achieving larger impacts with the same amount of effort when a system scales.]
[In short, a scalable system is a flexible one.]
[will adding more servers increase the capacity of the service?]
[How are new servers prepared, installed, and configured?]
[How quickly can you set up new computers to get them ready to be used?]
[Could you deploy a hundred servers with the same IT team that you have today?]
[Or would you need to hire more people to get it done faster?]
[Would all the deployed servers be configured exactly the same way?]
[If your company is rapidly hiring a lot of new employees, you'll need to have an onboarding process that can scale as needed.]
[applying the latest security policies and patches while making sure users' needs still get addressed all while more and more users join the network without new support staff to back you up.]
[Automation is an essential tool for keeping up with the infrastructure needs of a growing business.]
[For example, we could deploy a whole new server by running a single command and letting the automation take care of the rest.]
[We could also create a batch of user accounts with all the necessary permissions based on data already stored in the database, eliminating all human interaction.]
