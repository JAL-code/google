[In puppet, resources are the basic unit for modeling the configuration that we want to manage.]
[defining a file resource.]
[example_w1_q2_02_01.bash]
[managing files and directories.]
[simple rule that ensures that etc/sysctl.d exists and is a directory.]
[declaring a resource in puppet, we write them in a block that starts with the resource type ,in this case File.]
[example_w1_q2_02_02.bash]
[First, we explicitly say that this will be a file instead of a directory or a symlink then we set the contents of the file to the UTC time zone. Finally, we set the replace attribute to true, which means that the contents of the file will be replaced even if the file already exists.]
[file permissions the file owner, or the file modification time.]
[The puppet agent then turns the desired state into reality using providers.]
