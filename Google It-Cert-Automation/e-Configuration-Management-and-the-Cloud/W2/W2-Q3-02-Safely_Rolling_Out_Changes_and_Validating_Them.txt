[First, what do we mean by production?]
[production is the parts of the infrastructure where a service is executed and served to its users.]
[website, the servers that deliver the website content to the users are the production servers.]
[servers that validate users passwords are the production authentication servers,]
[The test environment should have one or more machines running the exact same configuration as the production environment.]
[As we briefly touched on in an earlier video, Puppet has environments picked in. Each environment has its own directory with its own set of manifests and modules.]
[it's also the whole contents of the modules.]
[You can define as many environments as you need.]
[development environment for IT specialists to try out new Puppet rules before they even reach the test environment, or say you're developing a very tricky new feature for your system and you don't know when it'll be ready.]
[This can include both manual verification and automated checking.]
[pushing changes to every machine at the same time is usually not a great idea.]
[So instead of pushing the changes to all nodes, we usually do it in batches.]
[You could have some machines with the fact that marks them as early adopters or canaries.]
[canaries that coal miners used to detect toxic gases in the mines,]
[notified of the problem, you can roll it back and avoid it hitting the rest of the fleet.]
[roll out your changes every one or two weeks.]
[start small and make improvements as you go. As your manifests get more complex, you want to improve the automated testing of all the pieces.]
