[Another way to apply different rules to different systems is to use separate *node definitions.]
[In Puppet terminology, a node is any system where we can run a Puppet agent.]
[physical workstation, a server, a virtual machine, or even a network router]
[Puppet to give some basic rules to all the nodes, but then apply some specific rules to the nodes that we want to be different.]
[node_1.pp]
[node_2.pp]
[We can see here that specific nodes in the fleet are identified by their FQDNs, or fully qualified domain names.]
[node definition for a host called webserver.example.com.]
[same sudo and ntp classes]
[listing the same classes because the classes included in the default node definition are only applied to the nodes that don't have an explicit entry.]
[Puppet will look at the node definitions, figure out which one matches the node's FQDN, and then give only those rules.]
[To avoid repeating the inclusion of all the common classes, we might define a base class that does the work of including all the classes that are common to all node types.]
[node definitions are typically stored in a file called site.pp, which isn't part of any module.]
[defines what classes will be included for what nodes.]
