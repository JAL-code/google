[different things to manage.]
[to install some packages, copy some configuration files, start some services, schedule some periodic tasks, make sure some users and groups are created and have access to specific devices, and maybe execute a few commands that aren't provided by existing resources.]
[different configurations applied to the different computers in the fleet.]
[workstations and laptops might include resources that aren't used on servers.]
[distinct type of server will need its own specific setup.]
[grouping related resources, giving the groups good names, and making sure that the organization will make sense to new users.]
[organize our manifests into modules.]
[A *module is a collection of manifests and associated data.]
[group things together under a sensible topic.]
[everything related to monitoring the computer's health, another one for setting up the network stack, and yet another one for configuring a web serving application.]
[All manifests gets stored in a directory called manifests.]
[files directory includes files that are copied into the client machines without any changes, like the ntp.conf file that we saw in our last video.]
[template's directory includes files that are preprocessed before they've been copied into the client machines.]
[include values that get replaced after calculating the manifests, or sections that are only present if certain conditions are valid.]
[start with the simple module that just has one manifest in the Manifest directory.]
[file should be called init.pp and it should define a class with the same name as the module that you're creating.]
[init.pp file,]
[stored in manifests file]
[ntp.conf file that gets deployed onto the machine is now stored in the files directory.]
[By now, there's a large collection of prepackaged modules that are shipped and ready to use.]
[lib directory that adds functions and fact to the ones already shipped by puppet.]
[metadata.json file includes some additional data about the module we just installed, like which versions of which operating systems it's compatible with.]
[this manifest is special. It needs to always be present because it's the first one that's read by puppet when a module gets included.]
[create a manifest file that includes the module we've just installed.]
[double colon before the module name, let's puppet know that this is a global module.]
