[Puppet agent connected to the Puppet master]
[CTL command,]
[control the services that are enabled when the machine starts and those that are currently running.]
[tell the system CTL to enable the puppet service so that the agent gets started whenever the machine reboots,]
[then we'll tell system CTL to start the puppet service so that it starts running.]
[Last step, we'll ask systems CTL for the status of the Puppet service to check that it's actually running.]
