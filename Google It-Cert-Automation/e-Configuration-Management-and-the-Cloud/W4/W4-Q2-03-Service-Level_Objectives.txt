[Sometimes a piece of infrastructure can be down and the overall system still works with degraded performance.]
[caching server that makes your web application go faster is down, the app can still function, even if it's running slower.]
[SLOs are pre-established performance goals for a specific service.]
[SLOs need to be measurable, which means that there should be metrics that track how the service is performing and let you check if it's meeting the objectives or not.]
[Availability targets like this one are commonly named by their number of nines.]
[Five nine services promised a total down time of up to five minutes in a year.]
[super high availability, reserved only for the most critical systems.]
[three nine service, aiming for a maximum of eight hours of downtime per year, is fine for a lot of IT systems.]
[because it's really expensive and usually not necessary.]
[two or three nines of availability might be enough.]
[Five nine services usually require a much larger team of engineers to maintain it.]
[Some services, like those that we pay for, also have more strict promises in the form of service level agreements, or SLAs.]
[A service level agreement is a commitment between a provider and a client. Breaking these promises might have serious consequences.]
[soft target, it's what the maintaining team aims for, but the target might be missed in some situations.]
[having explicit SLOs or SLAs is useful for both the users of that service and the team that keeps the service running.]
[If you're using a cloud service, you can decide how much you're going to entrust your infrastructure to it, based on the SLAs that the provider publishes.]
[maintains the service, you can use the SLOs and SLAs of your service to decide which alerts to create and how urgent they should be.]
[use the concepts of error budgets to handle their services.]
[the service can be down 43 minutes per month, this is your *error budget.]
[can tolerate up to 43 minutes of downtime, so you keep track of the total time the service was down during the month.]
