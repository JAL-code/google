[Instances might be added or removed from the pool as needed and if an individual machine crashes, my service needs to breeze along without introducing problems, and not every problem results in a crash, sometimes we run into quotas or limits, meaning that you can only perform a certain number of operations within a certain time period.]
[For example, when using Blob Storage there might be a limit of 1,000 writes to the same blob in a given seconds.]
[On top of that, there are also utilization limits, which cap the total amount of a certain resource that you can provision.]
[quotas are there to help you avoid unintentionally allocating more resources than you wanted.]
[you can ask for a quota increase from the Cloud provider if you want additional capacity,]
[If your service performance expensive operations routinely, you should make sure you understand the limitations of the solution that you choose.]
[quota on an auto-scaling system, the system will grow to meet user demand until it reaches the configured limit.]
[have good monitoring and alerting around behavior like this.]
[dependencies.]
[your service depends on a Platform as a Service offering]
[hosted database or CICD system, you're handing the responsibility for maintenance and upgrades of that service off to your Cloud provider, that's great, fewer things to worry about and maintain,]
[don't always get to choose what version of that software you're using.]
[either side of the upgrade cycle,]
[stay at a version that's working well]
[strong incentive to keep its service software fairly up-to-date.]
[customers aren't vulnerable to security flaws,]
[bugs are promptly fixed]
[new features get released early.]
[Cloud provider has to move carefully and test changes to keep destruction of its service to a minimum.]
[communicate proactively about changes to the services that you use]
[For example, you can set up a test environment for your service that uses the beta or prerelease version of a given software as a service solution, letting you test it before it impacts production.]
