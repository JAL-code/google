[Like adding more memory or moving the machine to a different data center.]
[You can't connect to the instances or boot them in rescue mode, so what can you do?]
[You could deploy new VMs with the previous version of the system, this would help us get back to a healthy state as quickly as possible.]
[you can create a snapshot of the disk image for one of the failing VMs. And then mount that disk image on a healthy machine.]
[trying to figure out what's causing your complex servers to respond with a ton of 500s.]
[Does the problem happen if you run the service and a test VM Without any load balancers or caching servers in between?]
[Does it happen if you run the service locally on your workstation?]
[So it's a good idea to do this in advance before any problem actually happens.]
[Say you're using a database service that's only reachable from inside your cloud network.]
[you might want to check the responses from the database directly.]
[To do this, you'll need to have a debugging machine in the network and you'll need to use tools to interact with the database directly.]
[Again, setting the machine up, and learning how to use the tools takes time. So get ahead of the game and do it in advance before any problems come up.]
[When you run your service in the cloud, you need to learn where to find the logs. That the provider keeps and what info is available in which logs.]
