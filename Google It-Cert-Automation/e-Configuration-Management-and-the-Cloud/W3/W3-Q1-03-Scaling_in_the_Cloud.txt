[traditional IT setting, if your team needs an extra server to improve the service, you need to buy additional hardware, install the operating system and application software and then integrate the new computer with the rest of the infrastructure.]
[In this context, capacity is how much the service can deliver.]
[available capacity is tied to the number and size of servers involved.]
[storing data, we might care about the total disk space available.]
[If we have a web server responding to queries from external users, we might care about the number of queries that can be answered in a second which is called queries per second or QPS.]
[This capacity change is called scaling.]
[In particular, we call it upscaling when we increase our capacity and downscaling when we decrease it.]
[There are a couple of different ways that we can scale our service in the Cloud, horizontally and vertically.]
[To scale a deployment horizontally, we add more nodes into the pool that's part of a specific service.]
[If you want to be able to serve 1,500 connections at the same time, you can deploy 10 Apache web servers and distribute the load across them. This is called horizontal scaling.]
[On the flip side, if you're scaling a deployment vertically, it means you're making your nodes bigger.]
[resources assigned to the nodes like memories, CPU, and disk space.]
[Depending on our deployment and our needs, we might need to scale both horizontally and vertically to scale the capacity of our service.]
[adding more and bigger nodes to our pool.]
[we just modify our deployment by clicking some buttons in a web UI or using a configuration management system to automate the scaling for us.]
[take into account is whether the scaling is done automatically or manually.]
[When we set our service to use automatic scaling, we're using a service offered by the Cloud provider. This service uses metrics to automatically increase or decrease the capacity of the system.]
[demand for these videos increases]
[the software in-charge of the automatic scaling will add resources and increase the overall capacity to meet this demand.]
[stop watching cat videos, the automation will remove any unused resources, so the operating costs stay small.]
[a reasonable quotas for your autoscaling systems.]
[On the flip side, using manual scaling means that changes are controlled by humans instead of software.]
[Say your company currently has a single mail server and you know that you'll want to have another one in six months. In that case, there's no need to overcomplicate that system with an autoscaler.]
[The trade-off here is that without good monitoring or alerting, a system without autoscaling technologies might suffer from unexpected increases in demand.]
[problems ranging from poor performance to an actual outage.]
