[As a reminder, automation is the process of replacing a manual step with one that happens automatically.]
[But all of this automatic creation of new instances needs to be coordinated so that the instances correctly interact with each other and that's where orchestration comes into play.]
[Orchestration is the automated configuration and coordination of complex IT systems and services.]
[So how does this work? The key here is that the configuration of the overall system needs to be automatically repeatable.]
[They normally use an application programming interface or API that lets us interact with the Cloud infrastructure directly from our scripts.]
[Say you wanted to deploy a system that combines some services running on a Cloud provider and some services running on-premise, this is known as a hybrid Cloud setup, or only part of the services are in the Cloud.]
[The setup is super common in the industry right now.]
[Going back to the website example that we discussed earlier to make sure that the service is running smoothly, we should set up a monitoring and alerting.]
[lets us detect and correct any problems with our service before users even notice.]
[critical piece]
[Automation is when we set up a single step in a process to require no oversight, while orchestration refers to automating the entire process.]
