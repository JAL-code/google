[you're running the service yourself, if something breaks, you can either physically walk up to the server to fix it or SSH into it from inside the same network.]
[cloud solutions, we need to give up some of this control to the cloud provider.]
[software, platform, or infrastructure as a service.]
[software as a service, we're basically giving the provider complete control of how the application runs.]
[software provided fulfills all of our needs and we'd rather just focus on using the software instead.]
[create our own applications, we can use platform as a service.]
[charge of the code, but we aren't in control of running the application.]
[infrastructure as a service, where we can still keep a high level of control.]
[operating system that runs on the virtual machines, the applications that are installed on it,]
[depend on the vendor for other aspects of the deployment, like the network configuration or the services availability.]
[break, you might need to get support from the vendor to fix the problem.]
[pretty great to not have to worry about maintaining the machines]
[workloads as a commodity, instead of special snowflakes.]
[hesitant to move to the cloud]
[what security measures are being put in place.]
[check how they're keeping your instances and your data secure.]
[certifications like SOC 1, ISO 27001, and other industry recognized credentials]
[as cloud users, we also have a responsibility to follow reasonable security practices.]
[Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and other cloud providers invest heavily in security research.]
[root password of your cloud instance password one]
[always use reasonable judgment to protect the machines that we deploy ,whether that's on physical server is running on-premise or on virtual machines in the Cloud.]
[highly sensitive deployments might warrant specialized security procedures, like multi-factor authentication, encrypted file systems, or public key cryptography.]
[recent patient health records,]
[patient health records from the 1800s, you'll need less comprehensive security measures,]
[For example, you might be worried of where your data is going to be stored.]
[support offered won't satisfy your needs.]
[read the terms of service to understand the conditions and figure out if the service offered will satisfy your needs.]
