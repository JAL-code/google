[some common actions that you might perform on the Cloud look in practice.]
[the Google Cloud platform to demonstrate our examples because, well, it's the platform we know best.]
[No matter the exact menu entries, when you want to create a VM running in the Cloud, there are a bunch of parameters that you need to set.]
[You'll start by choosing the name assigned to the instance. This name will later let you identify the instance if you want to connect to it, modify it, or even delete it.]
[You'll also have to choose the region and zone where the instance is running.]
[ choose a region that's close to your users so that you provide better performance.]
[the machine type for your VM.]
[how many processing units, or virtual CPUs, and how much memory the virtual machine will be allocated.]
[As a sysadmin, you may need to decide between costs and processing power to fit the needs of your organization.]
[start small and scale as needed.]
[select the boot disk that the VM will use.]
[When you create the VM, you select both how much space you want to allocate for the virtual disk and what operating system you want the machine to run.]
[can use the web interface or the command line interface.]
[web UI can be very useful for quickly inspecting the parameters that we need to set.]
[UI will let us compare the different options available and even show us an estimation of how much money our selected VM would cost per month.]
[use the command line interface, which lets us specify what we want once, and then use the same parameters many times.]
[create, modify, and even delete virtual machines]
[automate the preparation of the contents of those virtual machines.]
[Reference images store the contents of a machine in a reusable format, while templating is the process of capturing all of the system configuration to let us create VMS in a repeatable way.]
[A disk image is a snapshot of a virtual machine's disk at a given point in time.]
[Good templating software lets you copy an entire virtual machine and use that copy to generate new ones.]
[have the data that we need to make it reusable on lots of virtual machines.]
[to build a cluster of 10,000 machines which all have identical software.]
