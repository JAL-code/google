Google It-Cert-Automation

This is a repo for notes, codes and other documentation from the class. I plan to highlight the most important knowledge to remember while taking the 
Google IT Automation with Python Professional Certificate.

Note:  the material may be different from the course since I did not work with GitHub till the third class.
