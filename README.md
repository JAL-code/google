# google
This repo is related to Google It-Cert-Automation. These are my notes on topics including Python, Bash, Linux OS and Software, and using Terminal  to complete actions.

This folder is revised to work with spaces in the folder location.  

Example:  Google Folder_for_Python/example.py has a space in the file location for example.py script.
If the text is entered into a command the terminal will only look for "Google" or 'Google'.
To get this folder to work the character " needs a \" escape.
Now terminal will recognize the folder location as "Google Folder_for_Python/example.py".
