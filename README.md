This repo is related to Google It-Cert-Automation. These are my notes on topics including Python, Bash, Linux OS and Software, and using Terminal  to complete actions.

This folder is revised to work with spaces in the folder location.  

Example:  Google Folder_for_Python/example.py has a space in the file location for example.py script.
If the text is entered into a command the terminal will only look for "Google" or 'Google'.
To get this folder to work the character " needs a \" escape.
Now terminal will recognize the folder location as "Google Folder_for_Python/example.py".

April 2022: (Redirected Effort in conjunction with FAA folder)

  Added a new folder for Tkinter.  This is a self modivated effort to learn how to code GUIs with Python. I have added three outside sources for instructional material.

  The primary goal is develop a working stepped program that involves user interaction while processing a complex involved task.

 Dyson Sphere Project: (On Hold)
 
   Came up with a project to practice coding in Tkinter and Python.  I will be building an application to plan Dyson Sphere Program (DSP) Factories. The application will include a graphic user interface written in Tkinter. (See 'demo input.py' for starting development of idea.)
 Credits: oldshavingfoam (https://www.reddit.com/user/oldshavingfoam/) has produced some detailed graphs of the components and technologies in DSP. However I will be adding some acronyms to help develop the iterface with text only for simplicity of design. (how_to_make_things.py)
