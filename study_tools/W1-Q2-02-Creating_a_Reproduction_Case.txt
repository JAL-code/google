[A reproduction case is a way to verify if the problem is present or not.]
[pretty obvious.]
[missing directory,]
[login to the website and see the loading page.]
[more complex to discover.]
[application that won't start.]
[on your computer, the application starts just fine.]
[suspect that the problem has to do with something in the user's environment or configuration.]
[It could be problems with the network routing, old config files interfering with a new version of the program, a permissions problem blocking the user from accessing some required resource, or even some faulty piece of hardware acting out.]
[The first step is to read the logs available to you.]
[On MacOs, on top of the system logs, you'd go through the logs stored in the library logs directory.]
[On Windows, you'd use the Event Viewer tool to go through the event logs.]
[error message]
[unable to reach server, invalid file format, or permission denied.]
[error message is super unhelpful like internal system error.]
[The next step is to try to isolate the conditions that trigger the issue.]
[Do other users in the same office also experienced the problem? Does the same thing happen if the same user logs into a different computer? Does the problem happen if the applications config directory is moved away?]
[config directories file.]
[You ask the user to move it away without deleting it, and now the application starts correctly.]
[So you ask the user to send you the contents of that directory.]
[You copy them onto your computer, and the program fails to start.]
[Bingo, you got your reproduction case.]
[Having a clear reproduction case, let's do investigate the issue, and quickly see what changes it.]
[For example, does the problem go away if you revert the application to the previous version? Are there any differences in the strace log, or the ltrace logs when running the application with the bug config and without it?]
[On top of that, having a clear reproduction case, lets you share with others when asking for help.]
[aren't sharing any confidential information]
[report a bug to the applications developers, to ask for help from a colleague, or even to ask for help from an Internet forum about the application if it's publicly available.]
[So when trying to create a reproduction case, we want to find the actions that reproduce the issue, and we want these to be as simple as possible. The smaller the change in the environment and the shorter the list of steps to follow, the better.]
