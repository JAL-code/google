[Maybe you've dealt with programs that randomly crash, laptops that sometimes fail to suspend, web services that unexpectedly stop replying, or file contents that get corrupted.]
[bugs that come and go are hard to reproduce, and are extremely annoying to debug.]
[The first step is to get more involved in what's going on, so that you understand when the issue happens and when it doesn't.]
[Since you don't know exactly when the bug will trigger, you need to be thorough with the information that you log.]
[service IAM.]
[It was crashing sporadically, and I was at a loss trying to find out why.]
[Looking at the error message, I knew it had something to do with strings that use special characters, but I had no idea where the bug was exactly.]
[So I added more logging information to the service, around the inputs and the function calls that I suspect could be involved.]
[If you can't modify the code of the program to get more information, check if there's a logging configuration that you can change.]
[a debugging mode that generates a lot more output then the default mode.]
[If that's not possible, you'll need to resort to monitoring the environment when the issue triggers.]
[ look at different sources of information, like the load on the computer, the processes running at the same time, the usage of the network, and so on.]
[occur at random times, we need to repair our system to give us as much information as possible when the bug happens.]
[several iterations until we get enough information to understand the issue, but don't lose hope.]
[This is an especially annoying type of intermittent issue, nicknamed Heisenbug, in honor of Werner Heisenberg.]
[He's the scientist that first described the observer effect, where just observing a phenomenon alters the phenomenon.]
[These bugs usually point to bad resource management.]
[Maybe the memory was wrongly allocated, the network connections weren't correctly initialized, or the open files weren't properly handled.]
[need to just spend time looking at the effected code until we finally figure out what's up.]
[Yet another type of intermittent issue is the one that goes away when we turn something off and on again.]
[power cycling a device or restarting a program gets rid of whichever problem we were trying to fix.]
[almost certainly a bug in the software, and the bug probably has to do with not managing resources correctly.]
[If in the end, we can't find the actual reason, scheduling a restart at a time that's not problematic can also be an option.]
[like isolating causes, understanding error messages, adding logging information, and generating new ideas for possible failures.]
