[the program keeps terminating with an error.]
[First, let's try running the program ourselves and check if we can reproduce the problem.]
[It failed to send the email. This means we've reproduced the issue.]
[Again, I'll send this to myself to avoid spaming people with test reminders.]
[Which parameter do you think is at fault?]
[ the date. Let's try it once more with January 13th as the date and Sales All Hands as the title. Another failure.]
[Now, the next step is to find the root cause of the issue.]
[when dates are involved in a failure, the problem is due to how the dates are formatted.]
[let's add more debugging information to the program.]
[Zenity is the application showing the window to select the date, title, and emails.]
[To get more information about the output generated by Zenity, we'd like to see the value of the meeting_info variable before the Python script gets called. Let's add an echo statement to see that.]
[information generated by Zenity is split by pipes, and that the data is formatted as month, day, year.]
[Now, the next step is getting a more informative error.]
[The file is long, so it makes sense to start by looking at the main function that lists the core functionality of the program.]
[But the error message is not very useful, as it's hiding the reasons why things failed.]
[printing the exception that generated the failure.]
[As there's no month 13, this is an invalid date. So we found the root cause of the problem.]
[the next step is to remediate the issue.]
[We could change the program to use our date format, but then the application would break for people running it in a different location.]
[we need to change the Python script to use the same format.]
