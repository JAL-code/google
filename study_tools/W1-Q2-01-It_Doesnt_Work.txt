[the first step to solving a problem is getting  enough information so that we  can understand the current state of things]
[know  what the actual issue we're solving is]
[some common questions that we can  ask a user that simply report something doesn't work]
[What were you trying to do?]
[What steps did you follow?]
[What was the expected result?]
[What was the actual result?]
[save time and can  start asking more specific questions right away]
[check if it's  correctly plugged in]
[Say you got a call from a user  that tells you the internal website used  by the sales team to track  customer interactions doesn't work]
[What were they trying to do?  The user tells you that they're  trying to access the website.  What steps did they follow?  They tell you that they opened the website  URL and entered their credentials.  What was the expected result?  They expected to see the sales system's landing page.  What did they get instead?  The web page just keeps loading.  It stays blank forever. ]
[Now that you have a basic idea of what the problem is,  it's time to start figuring out the root cause.]
[reproduce the issue on your own computer.]
[So you navigate]
[the page just keeps loading,]
[This is enough information that you can tell  the user that you'll work on  it and investigate on your own.  There's no need to keep them on the line.]
[By reproducing the problem on your computer, you've taken a simple and quick action that rules out the user or the user's computer as the cause of the problem.]
[Before jumping into the server  that's hosting the application,  you run a few quick checks to verify if  the problem is isolated to that specific website or not. ]
[You check if your Internet access is working successfully]
[inventory website or  ticketing system are working okay.]
[the inventory website never finishes loading. ]
[It turns out both websites are hosted on the same server.]
[process of elimination, starting with the simplest explanations first and testing those until you can isolate the root cause. ]
[At this point, you know that  website's running on a specific server or failing to  load while the rest of  the systems and the Internet are working correctly. ]
[check  what's going on on that server. ]
[Linux machine,  so you'll connect to it using SSH. ]
[top command  which shows the state of the computer and  processes using the most CPU  and see that the computer is super overloaded. ]
[load average in the first line says 40.]
[load average on Linux shows  how much time a processor is busy in a given minute, heis with one meaning it was busy for the whole minute.]
[four cores, ]
[40 is a really high number. ]
[CPU time is spent in waiting. ]
[processes get  stuck gathering data from the hard drive or the network. ]
[Backing up the data on the system is super important.  But currently, the whole system is unusable. ]
[At this point, you've applied the immediate remediation. ]
